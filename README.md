## Project Description

**Chaotic System Simulator** is a simple web page that uses JavaScript and Three.js to render a 3D simulation of several chaotic systems in phase space.
The state of the system is represented by a single point in the 3D phase space while the trajectory followed by the point represent the evolution of the system state variables.
