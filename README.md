# Chaotic Systems Simulator


## Project Description

**Chaotic System Simulator** is simple web page that uses JavaScript and Three.js to render a 3D simulation of several chaotic systems in phase space.
The state of the system is represented by a single point in the 3D phase space while the trajectory followed by the point represent the
evolution of the system state variables.

There are several chaotic systems that can be simulated:

- **Lorenz Attractor**, a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection developed in 1963 by Edward Lorenz, Ellen Fetter and Margaret Hamilton.
- **Rössler Attractor**, a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations originally studied by Otto Rössler in the 1970s.
- **Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor**, a 3D strange attractor originally proposed by René Thomas.
- **Chua Circuit**, a simple electronic circuit that exhibits classic chaotic behavior, invented in 1983 by Leon O. Chua
- **Aizawa Attractor**
- **Rayleigh-Benard Attractor**
- Generate a single body selecting its mass, radius as well as its initial position and velocity
- Generate a random body

Through the "Settings" panel it is possible to change the timestep used for numerical integration and the gravitational constant.

## Usage

You can play with [N-Body Simulator](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SlowWave/n_body_simulator/blob/main/src/index.html) online,
otherwise, if you want to run the simulator on your local machine, simply clone this repository and open the index.html file with your browser.
