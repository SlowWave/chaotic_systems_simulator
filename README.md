# Chaotic Systems Simulator


## Project Description

**Chaotic System Simulator** is simple web page that uses JavaScript and Three.js to render a 3D simulation of several chaotic systems in phase space.
The state of the system is represented by a single point in the 3D phase space while the trajectory followed by the point represent the
evolution of the system state variables.

There are several chaotic systems that can be simulated:

- **Lorenz Attractor**, a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection developed in 1963 by Edward Lorenz, Ellen Fetter and Margaret Hamilton.
- **Rössler Attractor**, a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations originally studied by Otto Rössler in the 1970s.
- **Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor**, a 3D strange attractor originally proposed by René Thomas.
- **Chua Circuit**, a simple electronic circuit that exhibits classic chaotic behavior, invented in 1983 by Leon O. Chua
- **Aizawa Attractor**
- **Rayleigh-Benard Attractor**
